    "question_text": "A prism made of glass (n=1.5) is placed in air. If a light ray enters the prism, will it bend toward or away from the base of the prism, and why? Describe what happens as it exits the other side of the prism.",
    "choices": [
        "Bends towards the base upon entry, exits away from the base",
        "Bends away from the base upon entry, exits towards the base",
        "Does not bend",
        "Exits parallel to the base"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Bends towards the base upon entry, exits away from the base",
    "explanation": "According to Snell's Law, as light enters a denser medium (air to glass), it bends towards the normal. Since the prism is triangular, this results in bending towards the base. Upon exiting into air, it bends away from the normal due to the lower refractive index, moving away from the base.",
