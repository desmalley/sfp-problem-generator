    "question_text": "A light ray travels from air (index of refraction n=1.0) into water (index of refraction n=1.33) at an angle of 45° to the normal. In which direction does the light ray bend, and why?",
    "choices": [
      "Towards the normal",
      "Away from the normal",
      "Does not bend",
      "Refracts parallel to the normal"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Towards the normal",
    "explanation": "According to Snell's Law, light bends towards the normal when it moves from a medium of lower refractive index to a medium of higher refractive index.",
